``` r
# Save the lag corresponding to maximum autocorrelation
maxlag_sunspot <- 1
```

The ACF of the annual sun spots time series (above) shows a maximum
autocorrelation with the preceding year, but also a high autocorrelation
for a lag of 10-11 years and 21-22 years. Both confirm the known 10-11
year solar cycle.

``` r
# Plot the traffic on the Hyndsight blog
autoplot(hyndsight)

```

![](1_timeseries_r_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Save the lag corresponding to maximum autocorrelation
maxlag_hyndsight <- 7
```

The 7, 14 and 21 day maximums in the ACF for the hyndsight web traffic
time series (above) reflect a weekly cycle. We would not be surprised to
discover that maximum

# Stock prices and white noise

How predictable are daily changes in Google stock price?

``` r
# Plot the original series
autoplot(goog)

# Plot the differenced series
autoplot(diff(goog))

``` r
# ACF of the differenced series
ggAcf(diff(goog))
```

``` r
# Ljung-Box test of the differenced series
Box.test(diff(goog), lag = 10, type = "Ljung")
```

    ## 
    ##  Box-Ljung test
    ## 
    ## data:  diff(goog)
    ## X-squared = 13.123, df = 10, p-value = 0.2169

Ljung-Box is a test statistic for examining the null hypothesis of
independence, here evaluated in the time series of Google stock price
data for a range of *k* lags *jointly*. The null hypothesis is that the
first *k* autocorrelations are jointly zero.

  - p-value \< 0.05 (reject): the data are likely not serially
    independent (autocorrelations are not zero)
  - p-value \> 0.05 (not reject): the data may be be serially
    independent (autocorrelations are zero as in the case of white
    noise).

*How predictable are daily changes in Google stock price?* In the above
result we cannot reject the null hypothesis (p-value \> 0.05),
suggesting that the daily changes in the Google stock price over a lag
up to *k* = 10 time steps are random. This is in agreement with the
Efficient Market Hypothesis in economics that states that asset prices
reflect all available information. Assuming that all available
information is already priced into the current stock price, daily
changes in price are presumed random. This means that in terms of
forecasting, the current price is the best predictor of future price.

On a related note, we can use Ljung-Box in autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) modeling to test the null hypothesis of
independence of the time series of residuals (not of the original time
series). This is important because if the residuals are not independent
the model can be improved.
